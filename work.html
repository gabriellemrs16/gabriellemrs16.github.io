                        used in
                        Jupyter Notebook to import CSV files and make them into tables and graphs.</p>

                <h4>PowerBI and Database Courses</h4>
                <p>The PowerBI was done as a final project for my Data Warehousing course. I had to add the appropriate
                    columns from a given database, then find certain information that the professor was curious about,
                    such as the top 5 and top 10 best and worst-selling products.
                </p>
                <p>Also learned in the Data Warehousing course, was restoring a backed-up database in SQL Server, then
                    connect that database with SSIS in Visual Studio. I was then able to successfully update the
                    database using the SSIS data flowcharts I created.
                </p>
                <p>In my Big Data Programming and Reporting course, I was taught how to use Hadoop with Apache Spark in
                    Ubuntu. I also used pyspark in Jupyter Notebook with python.

                <h4>Web Fundamentals Final Project</h4>
                <p>Completed in Sublime Text 3 using HTML and CSS, my final project for my Web Fundamentals course was
                    my very first website. It consists of 4 pages, including one on how to save the honey bees, as I
                    love them and think they are adorable. I made the project as a rough website for my mom, who started
                    a beeswax candle business but has since ceased.

                    provided by the professor. It was built through MVC and done over the course of the term. This
                    project shows how well I am at following instructions and completing tasks on time, while asking
                    questions if needed.

                    registered food charity in Niagara Falls. This project taught me how to work in a team. It also
                    taught me that not everyone approves of everything and that communication is vital.

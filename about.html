                    <p>
                        I am a computer programmer analyst who
                        has experience in using networking tools such as
                        Visual Studio, GitHub and SQL Server.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I recently graduated from Niagara College with
                        a 3-year diploma in the Computer Programming and
                        Analyst program, attaining a GPA of 82. During my
                        time in this program, I have learned to work
                        efficiently in a team while in a networking
                        environment, and I have received beneficial
                        hands-on experience managing and troubleshooting
                        the hardware and software that make up a computer network.

                        In my personal life,
                        I enjoy family game night,
                        watching YouTube,
                        spending time with my pup,
                        watching cooking shows,
                        and seeing my boyfriend.

                    <h3>Dress and act appropriately.</h3>
                    <p>As a co-op student and retail worker, I followed
                        dress codes and wore work-appropriate attire while
                        acting professional. I will have to dress sharply
                        for office work and act qualified.

                    <h3>Portray a professional image through reliability, consistency, and honesty.</h3>
                    <p>In my personal life, I have learned that reliability,
                        consistency, and honesty, all rely on each other.
                        If you are dishonest and inconsistent, you become
                        unreliable, which is unacceptable for a work environment.</p>

                    <h3>Deliver work outcomes to agreed quality standards and timescales.</h3>
                    <p>Being part of a team has taught me the importance of teamwork
                        and good communication. I also learned that not
                        delivering your work to the agreed-upon standards
                        and time does not fare well with the rest of the group,
                        as it could push everyone behind schedule; especially
                        if your work has to get redone.</p>
